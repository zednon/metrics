          How visible is your UX work?
        </h2>


        <p>You and your team work hard to improve things for your users, customers, and employees. Yet, it seems nobody sees how hard you labor.
        </p>

        <p>How visible are your UX efforts? </p>


        <p>Do your stakeholders see how vital your work is? Are they seeing the benefits of delivering exceptional UX?</p>

        <p>You can’t expect executives and stakeholders to invest in and prioritize your team’s efforts without making your UX work visible.
        </p>

        <p>Delivering a great user experience will contribute to every essential business objective. Yet, how can you drive your organization to consistently deliver great UX in every product and service when the UX is invisible? 
        </p>




        <h3><b>Visibility is your number one UX leadership priority.
          </b></h3>

        <p>What are you doing to make UX visible in your organization?</p>

        <p>How do you make sure that, at all levels across your organization, 
          UX efforts are seen as a significant strategic contributor to what 
          your organization is working to accomplish?</p>

          <h3><b> UX Metrics make the invisible visible.

          </b></h3>

        <p>Effective UX metrics track the critical improvements to the user 
          experience of your products or services.
        </p>

        <p>With robust metrics, your UX team’s work and the benefits that come from that work become highly visible. UX metrics make your work visible to your stakeholders, to your executives, and across your organization.</p>

        <h3><b>Not all UX metrics are equal.
        </b></h3>

      <p>We hear about UX metrics often. They sometimes have fancy names, such as HEART, SUS, Net Promoter Score, time on page, conversion rate, task time, satisfaction, or sentiment analysis. </p>

      <p>These conventional metrics are what teams gravitate to. Unfortunately, these metrics do not make their work more visible. 
      </p>

      <p>Conventional metrics embody magical thinking. These metrics don’t help your organization see the value of UX. They don’t make your UX effort more visible. 
      </p>

      <p>They often end up hiding the real achievements the team has had because these conventional. What good is it doing if your metrics do not show improvements in the users’ experiences? Sometimes, it’s not clear what they show. (We’re looking at you, Net Promoter Score.)
      </p>

      <h3><b>Are you measuring the UX improvements you’re delivering?
      </b></h3>

    <p>Conventional UX metrics don’t measure a user’s actual experience. They don’t measure what was frustrating about the experience for the user. They don’t show when new designs have eliminated those frustrations.
    </p>

    <p>Conventional UX metrics don’t measure when your users and customers find your unique designs delightful. They don’t measure when you’ve exceeded the users’ expectations or anticipated your customers’ needs.
    </p>

    <p>Conventional UX metrics don’t measure whether your team has improved users’ or customers’ lives. What good is all your hard work if your UX isn’t improving your users’ lives? 
    </p>

    <p>If you don’t know if your customers’ and users’ lives improved because of your UX work, how will your stakeholders and executives? You need far better metrics to make these improvements work.

          Outcome-driven UX Metrics
        </h2>
        <h3> Measuring your users’ actual experience.
        </h3>

        <p><b>Outcome-driven UX Metrics</b> is our radical approach to combating the issues caused by conventional metrics.  </p>
        <p>When you use Outcome-driven UX Metrics, you’ll directly track the user experience improvements your team makes.  </p>
        <p>It’s not based on the magical thinking you find in conventional UX metrics approaches. No more complicated explanations about how conversion rates, NPS, or the HEART framework demonstrate how the experience is better for customers and users. No more explaining why numbers didn’t change, even though you improved your design. No more guessing why your numbers change by themselves, even though you didn’t deliver anything new.</p>
        <p>Outcome-driven UX Metrics focus you, your team, stakeholders, and executives on improving your customers’ and users’ lives. These improvements are so exceptional that customers immediately see the enhanced value, and users see increased benefits.
        </p>
        <p>Outcome-driven UX Metrics make UX distinctively visible. </p>


        <h3>Showcase precisely where you’re delivering value</h3>

        <p>You’ll start with what we call a <i>UX Outcome.</i> Your UX outcome answers a simple question: 
          How will you improve your users’ and customers’ lives? Ultimately, you’ll build your metrics around this question.</p>
        <p>Using your UX outcome, you’ll create three categories of metrics:</p>
        <div class="padding25">
<ul>
  <li><i>UX Success metrics:</i> Report the precise moment you’ve improved your customers’ and users' lives.
  </li>
  <li><i>UX Progress metrics:</i> Achieve key results as your team progresses against your planned milestones.</li>
  <li><i>Problem-value metrics:</i> Pinpoint and aggregate your organization’s ongoing costs of poor UX to promote UX’s 
    return on investment. 
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

        <p>Each of these metrics categories helps you tell the story of your UX journey. The story of where you’re going, where you started, and how far along you are.</p>
        <p>Outcome-driven UX Metrics are simple in their concepts. Once you acquire the fundamentals, you’re ready to implement your own. </p>
        <p>And once you implement your own Outcome-Driven UX Metrics, you’ve unleashed a superpower. You’ll spark exceptional outcomes with your UX metrics as the foundation.
        </p>
        <p><b>You need Outcome-driven UX metrics to drive your organization.</b></p>

      Outcome-driven UX Metrics: How this Intensive works
    </h2>
<p>This is an online workshop, unlike any other workshop you’ve ever experienced. 
  We call it an intensive because, well, it’s intense. 
</p>
<p>You’ll discover how your UX team will:
</p>
<div class="padding25">
  <ul>
  <li>Define organization-wide UX goals that capture the attention of your stakeholders and executives.

  </li>
  <li>Elevate “improving your customers’ and users’ lives” to become a top organization objective.
  </li>
  <li>Take the lead on measuring and reporting the organization’s progress with the full support of your senior management.
  </li>
  </ul>
  </div>
<p>
  This workshop is 7½ hours, spread across five days. You’ll join Jared Spool on a comprehensive exploration to 
  <b>develop your own organization’s Outcome-driven UX Metrics</b>. You’ll complete your journey with metrics that 
  will <b>drive your organization to deliver better-designed products and services</b>. 
</p>

<p>
  You won’t make up imaginary, over-simplified metrics for fake companies and products in this intensive. Instead, you 
  (and your team, if you bring them along) will roll up your sleeves and identify the critical metrics for your products and services.

      <p>Roll up your sleeves and plan to get to work.</p>
      <p>There won’t be fake companies to create over-simplified metrics for. Nothing here will be “practice.” </p>
      <p>Instead, you’ll be doing the actual work of crafting your team’s UX metrics. You’ll create
        industrial-strength metrics that will capture the attention of your executives and stakeholders.</p>
      <p>You’ll use your <b>Outcome-Driven UX Metrics workbook</b> to guide your efforts. Then, you’ll start applying
        everything you learn right away. </p>
      <p>You’ll come away from the intensive with your own custom set of metrics. Bring your team in on the process,
        and you’ll have even better results.</p>
      <p>Might miss a session? No worries. We’ll record everything, so you can catch up on anything you miss.</p>
      <p>You’ll have questions. We’re ready for that. The sessions are each 90 minutes, so we should have plenty of
        time. 
      </p>
      <p>And we’ll ensure you have the confidence you need to do this right. We have created a dedicated private area
        in our <i> Leaders of Awesomeness </i> community. Put your questions there for Jared and the community to share their
        thoughts. 
      </p>
      <p>Discuss the gnarliest of challenges, and you’ll come away with all the assurance you need that you’ve got
        this.</p>

        <p>Everything you learn in this Intensive comes directly from Jared’s years of working across industries,
          discovering the best practices for organizations to deliver well-designed products and services.</p>
        <p>His experience working with design leaders of organizations like IBM, NASA, GE, Fidelity Investments, SAP,
          GM, Exxon Mobil, and the Obama White House has taught him exactly what teams need to mount strategic,
          influential UX research initiatives.</p>
        <p>You’ll love his stories, his ability to demonstrate every point with a simple, concrete example, and his
          comically adorable attempts to draw out his ideas. (You can’t fault him for trying, though.)</p>
        <p>Most importantly, you’ll love how smarter you’ll feel after spending a few minutes absorbing his
          experience-informed wisdom. Don’t pass up this opportunity to glean everything you can from Jared.</p>

            <h4>S. K., CX and Service Designer:</h4>
          </div>
          <p>I participated in UX Metrics Intensive with UX, Product, and Strategy leaders from world over. Thank you
            Jared Spool and team for a wonderful collaborative learning experience. I learned new things and found
            vocabulary and framework for things I was already doing. </p>
          <p>Seeing that product and design leaders world over had similar challenges and discussing how to deal with
            them with their questions around their real life projects was the best learning format for those looking for
            more than just intro to UX sort of material. Jared discussing my work with a current client was icing on the
            cake. </p>

            <h4>A.W., Senior User Experience Manager:</h4>
          </div>
          <p>I've had the pleasure of participating in this UX strategy series hosted by Jared. Jared ran sessions every
            day with discussions focused on topics of UX leadership and strategy, along with shared experiences and
            lively Q&A. </p>
          <p>He kindly took my question about the challenges of UX leadership for young or start-up organizations,
            bringing in the concept of Product-Market fit. This concept is spot on for companies that need a nimble UX
            strategy. </p>
          <p>If you are a UX leader or interested in UX leadership I highly recommend joining.</p>
