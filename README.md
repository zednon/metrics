# Welcome to the metrics repo

## Changes made for the Metrics Recordings Landing page February 2023

- removed inlines stles and designated an ```<h1>``` element in the hero section

- combined some styles to all be under the same id or class

- Removed sections of html that are no longer needed

- Added images from Figma file. 

- Replaced the calendar card images with recording topic images.
    - Changed class from cal-card-image to card-image for these images/divs
    - Change alt tag to "Cartoon graphic of computer screen"



## Questions 

- Why isn't the white background specified? There is a class for white back ground but this is never used. Is this helpful for dark mode? Is white #ffffff the default for most browswers so no need?

- How do I tell what the em default is for a page? I want to change all px to rem but I gotta make sure I know the em first.
